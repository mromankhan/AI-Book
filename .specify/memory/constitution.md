# Physical AI: Humanoid & Robotics Systems Book Constitution

## Vision
Creating comprehensive, accessible education in Physical AI and Robotics that empowers beginners and intermediate learners to understand, develop, and deploy intelligent systems that interact with the physical world through hands-on learning experiences.

## Core Principles

### Practical Hands-On Learning
All concepts must be taught through real-world examples, mini projects, simulations, and step-by-step labs. Theory must always be followed by practical implementation to reinforce understanding and ensure readers can apply knowledge effectively.

### Docusaurus Documentation Standard
All content follows Docusaurus documentation architecture with proper categorization, navigation, and styling consistent with documentation best practices. This ensures a professional presentation and optimal learning experience for readers.

### Git Branching Workflow
All content development occurs in feature branches with no direct commits to main branch. Only specific Git commands are allowed (git status, git add, git commit) with clear descriptive messages to maintain a clean, organized project history.

### Physical AI Integration Focus
Content emphasizes the integration of AI models with physical systems, including sensors, actuators, perception, and control systems. This core focus ensures readers understand how AI connects with the physical world in humanoid and robotic applications.

### Beginner-Friendly Approach
Content is designed for beginner to intermediate learners with basic programming knowledge but new to Physical AI & Robotics. Concepts are explained clearly with adequate background information to ensure accessibility for all skill levels.

### Educational Excellence
All content must meet high educational standards with clear objectives, assessments, and measurable learning outcomes. Each section should contribute meaningfully to the reader's understanding and practical capabilities.

## Success Criteria
Success of the book is measured by reader engagement, comprehension, completion rates, and practical implementation of concepts learned. Additionally, success includes positive feedback from the target audience, industry recognition, and adoption as a reference material in educational institutions.

## Constraints
Technical constraints include using Docusaurus as the platform with its associated architecture limitations. Educational constraints require maintaining accessibility for beginner audiences while covering advanced topics. Workflow constraints mandate development via Git branches with limited commands for consistency and quality control.

## Stakeholders
Primary stakeholders include software developers, CS students, and AI enthusiasts seeking to understand Physical AI and robotics. Secondary stakeholders encompass educators using the book as a resource, industry professionals seeking reference materials, and the broader AI community interested in accessible learning resources.

## Brand Voice
The content maintains an approachable, encouraging tone that demystifies complex concepts. Language is clear and jargon-free when possible, with definitions provided for necessary technical terminology. The personality is supportive, promoting experimentation and hands-on exploration while maintaining academic rigor and professional standards.

## Governance
This constitution governs all content development decisions for the Physical AI: Humanoid & Robotics Systems book project. All contributors must adhere to these principles in their work. Amendments to this constitution require community review and consensus before implementation.
