## The Rise of Embodied Intelligence

Traditional AI operates in digital spaces -- processing text, images, and data. Physical AI takes this further by giving intelligent systems a body that can perceive, decide, and act in the real world.

Key breakthroughs driving this field:

- **Foundation models for robotics** -- Large language models are being adapted to understand physical actions and spatial reasoning
- **Sim-to-real transfer** -- Training robots in simulation and deploying learned behaviors in the real world
- **Multimodal perception** -- Combining vision, touch, force sensing, and proprioception for robust environmental understanding

## Why Learn This Now?

The robotics industry is experiencing unprecedented growth. Companies like Tesla (Optimus), Figure AI, Boston Dynamics, and Agility Robotics are racing to build general-purpose humanoid robots. Understanding the fundamentals of physical AI positions you at the forefront of this revolution.

## Core Skills You Need

To work in physical AI, you need a blend of:

- **Mechanical intuition** -- Understanding joints, links, degrees of freedom
- **Control theory** -- PID controllers, feedback loops, trajectory planning
- **Machine learning** -- Supervised learning, reinforcement learning, neural networks
- **Systems thinking** -- Integrating software, hardware, sensors, and actuators

Our book covers all of these topics in depth. Start with [Part 1: Robotics Fundamentals](/docs/part-1-robotics-fundamentals/chapter-1.1-anatomy-of-a-robot) if you're new to the field.
