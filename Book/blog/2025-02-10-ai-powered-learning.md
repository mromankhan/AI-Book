We've integrated a RAG-powered AI chatbot directly into the book. It understands every chapter, can answer your questions with source citations, and even personalizes content based on your background.

## How It Works

Our AI assistant is built on a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** architecture:

1. **Content Ingestion** -- Every chapter is broken into semantic chunks and embedded into a vector database
2. **Smart Retrieval** -- When you ask a question, the system finds the most relevant passages from the book
3. **Contextual Generation** -- An AI model generates an answer grounded in the actual book content, with source citations

## Features

### Ask Anything
Click the chat button in the bottom-right corner and ask any question about robotics, AI, or the book content. The assistant will respond with accurate, sourced answers.

### Text Selection
Select any text in any chapter and click "Ask AI about this" to get deeper explanations, simplified summaries, or related concepts.

### Personalized Content
Sign in and click "Personalize" on any chapter. The AI will adapt the content to match your programming level, hardware experience, and educational background.

### Urdu Translation
Click "Translate" to get any chapter translated to Urdu with proper RTL formatting and Nastaliq typography.
